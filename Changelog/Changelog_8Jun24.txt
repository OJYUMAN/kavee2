1.Added a new file, named "converter.json" , generated by running dictionary.py directly. It is a json file that has words as keys and phonetics as the value. The file looks like this:

{...,
	"กงวาน": "3c",
    "กงเวียน": "3ej",
    "กงสี": "e",
    "กงสุล": "9h",
    "กช, กช-": "-",
    "กชกร": "9",
    "กฎ": "4",
    "กฎกระทรวง": "wg",
    "กฎเกณฑ์": "",
    "กฎข้อบังคับ": "5b",
    "กฎทบวง": "wg",
    "กฎธรรมชาติ": "4dc",
    "กฎธรรมดา": "c",
    "กฎบัตร": "9b",...}

2. Added ,encoding = "utf8" to every instance of open() because if unspecified, can cause some errors in some devices.

3. By using the converter.json file, using the cutdictionaryword(), findword(), getwordinfo() is now redundant. The old functions are commented. (These functions are in the dictionary.py file)

4. Modified the matchingsound() function to return all rhyming words as a list of pairs of definitions and the actual words. Making the getword() function redundant. The getword() function is commented.

5. As a follow-up to the 4th change, the app.py file is also changed accordingly.

6. Added formatting to the sentence 'พบคําคล้องจองทั้งหมด n คํา' the script.js file.
Example:
	used to be : พบคําคล้องจองทั้งหมด50คํา
	now : พบคําคล้องจองทั้งหมด 50 คํา
